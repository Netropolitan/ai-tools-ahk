## What's this?  

An interface-less calculator for Windows that lets you do basic math without having to leave the line you're typing on.  

**Where can it be used?**  

Almost anywhere in windows where you can enter text. Any text editor, search box or command line... even the text edit box that you use to rename files.  
&nbsp;  


## Installation  

Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/ecornell/ai-tools-ahk/releases) .zip file. If you already have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) installed then run `AI-Tools.ahk`, otherwise run the `.exe` version which lets you use the script without having AutoHotkey installed. The script doesn't install anything and it's also portable so it can be run from any location.  
&nbsp;


## Usage

Press the equals key to activate the calculator, type out an equation, then use one of the two end keys to calculate it

#### How does it work?







## Options

*(Any time you make any changes to the `settings.ini` file you will need to select "Reload This Script" from the tray icon to update the script with the new settings)*   


**Start with windows**  

To have the script start when windows boots up, select "Start With Windows" from the tray icon.
